## Js Vanilla random image generator


[You can click here and test this script](https://js.simschab.fr/picgenerator/index.html)

- Use the current window height.

- As long as the window height is not filled, it continues to generate and append images.

- If the window height is filled but the user enlarges it then we start again to generate and append images.

- Images are randomly generated by requests on LoremPicsum 

- Requested images size are dynamically changed if the window size is changed.

- On phone, effects applied to images change depending on the phone tilt on the X axis.

- If the screen inclination X axis value is reached, an information message is displayed to inform you.

- On desktop, effects applied to images change depending mouse-in and mouse-out on the image on which the mouse is positioned.

- Everything here is done in javascript vanilla.

- This script can be used as an example to understand how to use [accelerometer ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Accelerometer) the on phones to create actions.
