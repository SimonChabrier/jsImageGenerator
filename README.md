## Js Vanilla image generator

https://js.simschab.fr/picgenerator/index.html

This image generator uses the current window dimensions.

As long as the window is not filled, it continues to generate and add images.

If the window is filled but the user enlarges it then we start to generate images again.

Images are randomly generated and optimized based on the current window size.

On phone, the display of images changes depending on the tilt of the phone on the X axis.

If the screen inclination value is reached, an information message is displayed.

On a computer, the style of the images is changed by hovering the mouse over the current image.

Everything here is done in javascript vanilla.

This is a simple example to understand how to use the accelerometer on phones to create actions.
